# PythonDataStructures
/--------\


PROJECT CURRENTLY HOLDS:


.Various implementations of Data Structures in Python to be used in secondary language that it's on development.
.Beginnings of simplified language for fast DS creation.


\--------/


//------\\


.The objective of the project is to develop a Lexer and Parser component that will read a specific programming language (currently on development) that it's designed to generate some customized data structures in the python programming language and to give these usage to store and contain information.


\\------//


//------\\


.PLY lexer and yacc modules are the key components in the full development of the language. Syntatic rules and restrictions will be specified for the new language in order to reduce and customize the creation and format of said data structures.


\\------//


//------\\


.The expected outcome of the project is a user friendly language that allows a rapid and intuitive materialization of complex DS.
